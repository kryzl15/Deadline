                <h2>The most beautiful palaces</h2>
                <p>The palaces of South Korea and its capital, Seoul, are tourist attractions every traveller can visit when visiting the South Korean capital. During the Joseon dynasty, from fourteenth to twentieth century (1392–1910), quite a few palaces were built, such as the Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung and Gyeonghuigung. They represent over five hundred years of South Korea’s tradition. With their typical Asian style, the life of South Koreans and the Joseon dynasty, these South Korean palaces, which are cultural attractions, depict the development of the city of Seoul.</p>
